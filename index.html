            <em>I'm lucky to have found Alex and his team at Multicora. It all started as I was looking to have a mobile app developed that integrated with a SaaS application for IT Service Providers. I spoke with several web and app development firms and was very disappointed on how many of them didn't understand my vision and were more interested in selling me their other products and services. Frustrated and beginning to lose interest in the project, I met Alex. Alex and his team stood out from the crowd immediately. They didn't try to push products and services that I didn't want or need and instead they took the time to understand my vision and guided me through the buying process. I had a great experience with all the mock ups they did and the insights they shared the entire time. I had many choices while searching and I saw immediatly these guys weren't the same. If your considering or evaluating working with Alex and his team at Multicora, save yourself some time and hassle of evaluating so many firms and have a conversation with Alex and experience for yourself the reason I selected them not just once but many times for my web and app developement projects.</em>

          Multicora team have been wonderful to work with. I have worked with them to build a web app as well as a website/blog. They are detailed and communicative in their project management.</em>

            <em>They listen as well as provide creative suggestions on the project at hand. In addition, guys are always looking above and beyond to help you, not just development-wise but also regarding the overall strategy of your project. As of matter of fact, our relationship seems more like we are a partnership rather than a client - vendor relationship.
Lastly, I love how they look for ways to save money whether it's how they manage their time or the tools they suggestion using. For these guys, it's always about the customer experience, whether that is you or your customer or both.</em>
